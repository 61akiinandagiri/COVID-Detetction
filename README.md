# COVID-Detection
COVID-19 has until recently been identified as a very contagious and deadly bacterial
meningitis-type disease. Novel coronavirus or SARS-COV-2 virus is accountable for COVID-19
and therefore by affecting the health of the public around the planet it has already
demonstrated the lethal essence of respiratory disease. Clinical study shows that a person
infected with COVID-19 can encounter dry cough, muscle pain, headache, fever, sore throat
and mild to moderate respiratory disease. At the very same time, virus infection is seriously
affecting the lungs. At the very same time, infectious disease is seriously affecting the lungs.
The lung may therefore be a notable internal organ for diagnosing the extent of COVID-19
disease using chest images from X-Ray and CT scans. RT-PCR is an established research
technique for detecting coronavirus infection despite having lengthy testing period. It may
offer more false detection results at times than the desired levels. Of this purpose, to endorse
the conventional RT-PCR approach of effective clinical diagnosis, COVID-19 screening should
be implemented for an individualâ€™s personal X-Ray and CT scan images of the lung. This article
presents a image augmentation methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN) using
transfer learning model to detect COVID19 in chest X-ray and chest CT scan images of suspected
individuals with coronavirus. Augmentation of images allows use of deformation information
gathered in the filtered images to increase the number of successful examples for training the
transfer learning model. With this method the analysis shows higher classification accuracy for
CT scans and X-Ray images respectively about 92 percent and 92 percent. The test was carried
out on publicly accessible databases containing both X-Ray and CT scanning images and the
experimental findings are also correlated with the 3 transfer images.
